# CompTIA-Improving-Network-Security

Completed a hands-on module focused on foundational network security practices. Exercises included identifying common network security threats, updating antimalware signatures to ensure up-to-date protection, and working with Snort, a popular open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS), to monitor and analyze network traffic.

Completed a practical module focused on core network security skills.
Key exercises included:
